# APRIL
Headquarters of the [APRIL research lab](https://april-tools.github.io/), collecting our tools, codebases,etc.

We design probabilistic ML systems that are **_#provably_** **_#reliable_** in the **_#wild_** by combining **_#complex_** **_#reasoning_** with **_#efficient_** **_#inference_** and **_#learning_**.

You can also see [who we are](https://april-tools.github.io/people/) and [what we do](https://april-tools.github.io/publications/). Get in touch!
